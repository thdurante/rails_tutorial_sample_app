Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application
==========================================

This is the sample application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

Configuration
-------------
In order to resize images, we use the image manipulation program [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/), which we need to install on the development environment. (When using Heroku for deployment ImageMagick comes pre-installed in production.) 
To install the program run:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick --fix-missing
```
